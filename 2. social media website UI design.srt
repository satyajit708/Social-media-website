1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,500
Welcome back, so impressively, we made this wireframe for our social media app.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,510
So in this video, we are going to make the actual UI for that.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,930
I think I have to remember the name this wire frame, so I will only this is the wire from.

4
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:32,110
OK, let's choose a frame that is going to be our next door and the rectangle on the and just to center

5
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,190
on this.

6
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,200
Is foreign.

7
00:00:52,510 --> 00:01:01,270
OK, so you can see the all corners are sharp, so let's make them all around or chipped and select

8
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:01,900
them all.

9
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,020
Let's crank up to like 20.

10
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,320
Oh, sorry, I accidentally use this traditional tool.

11
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,660
I have to use the corner radius, so it is most frequently, OK.

12
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,310
There's the background color of this frame.

13
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,580
It's a bit gray.

14
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:34,730
Look, watch a little bit, and let's make them all a white.

15
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,300
Look at this and add a drop shadow.

16
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:46,630
OK, and it's in the color thing to like, which bluish.

17
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,630
So it totally depends on you which color you want to use.

18
00:01:52,740 --> 00:02:01,950
So let's say for working on air and you don't know like what color to use, then you can use this website

19
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,240
called Color Hunt.

20
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,170
And in this website, you will get lots of color ballots like this one.

21
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,560
So for this project, I'm going to use this color palette.

22
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,790
So I really don't read it, so I'm going to just drag it on my figma project.

23
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,540
I think this one.

24
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,400
So let's try this one.

25
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:35,230
So for this section, I'm going to choose, say, this column.

26
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,310
It will argue like that this white.

27
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,130
OK.

28
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:48,100
And let's add a profile logo or you.

29
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,790
OK, now it is time to earn our icons like Go.

30
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,610
Let me see if I can.

31
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,800
We get like two of them, like this round on all this square one for this project.

32
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:16,850
I'm going to use this one.

33
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,170
So it totally depends on your office searching.

34
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:29,580
Setting and home also, we are on this call.

35
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,100
You.

36
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:35,400
Logo.

37
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,690
So for now, I'm important this icons or less and then one of my one.

38
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,050
So first of all, let's make them a little bit bigger.

39
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,630
So, you know, I use like 30 for.

40
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,910
So let's make it up to 40.

41
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:57,070
So it will look more better or more interesting.

42
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,430
I think I have to change the color of it, let's make it right.

43
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,670
OK, go to selection and let's make them light, so.

44
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,980
This is not selected, so that's my point.

45
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,320
OK, let's entertain one by one.

46
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,040
And now it is going to be over here.

47
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,420
You know, he's going to be asked to call.

48
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,030
And she's going to be.

49
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,130
Checked and sitting.

50
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,130
In this them.

51
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,270
Hold shift, select them all and R&amp;D center.

52
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,510
Alan, what is interesting this?

53
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,150
Let's and spacing.

54
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,580
OK, so our spacing also.

55
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,250
Oculus earned a profile.

56
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,690
Click on Go to ship to the image.

57
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,160
So let's chew like this property.

58
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,930
OK, let's place it on this logo.

59
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,430
You can see in this place now and also look perfect.

60
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,500
So this early stroke?

61
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:19,500
So we totally depends on you, if you want to add stroke, you can or you can live as it, it's like

62
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:19,800
this.

63
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:26,670
OK, one thing is something that so we are in currently jurisdiction, so it's clear that.

64
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,520
Rectangle.

65
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,020
You're listing the color of it.

66
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,660
I'm going to use this for it.

67
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,570
And to look at this one.

68
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,240
And listing the color of it into this one.

69
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,160
Let's bring that message sort of calling to front.

70
00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:00,190
Click on it and link to front, are you going to use that right square bracket or shortcut?

71
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,000
OK, so if I like zoom out, you can see.

72
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,800
It looks.

73
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,390
OK, so user will know he's in this jurisdiction.

74
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,270
Like this?

75
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,100
OK, so let's make a group text audio.

76
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,670
OK, Alison, antiseptics, thanks.

77
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,470
Oh, sorry.

78
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:31,210
To six, I want to make one or so misspellings.

79
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,240
So let's change the font.

80
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,210
I like the font popping.

81
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:43,090
And let's make it bolt like this.

82
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,850
Now this act or groups.

83
00:06:53,080 --> 00:07:00,610
Girls are too attached, so let's say this is the group from your college.

84
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,750
Let's make it a regular.

85
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,740
I heard a line audio.

86
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,000
OK.

87
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,860
The digital.

88
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:17,700
And is it?

89
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,610
Like this, and I think I'm going to change the color of it, and we'll make it a bit like a green.

90
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:27,800
OK.

91
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:29,790
OK.

92
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,400
Like this one?

93
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,990
So let's say someone dropped the message or something like.

94
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,770
Let's stick with the font size up to like four.

95
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:45,820
Like this?

96
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,720
Careless at the time.

97
00:07:53,130 --> 00:08:02,430
So you will know when this message is delivered, what he got from someone.

98
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,570
A on 30.

99
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,010
At 8.30, he got a message from that group.

100
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,140
So let's change the.

101
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,300
OK, just make it up.

102
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:18,580
OK.

103
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,080
I think I may made up collecting.

104
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,740
And he told him.

105
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:32,730
Let's make it a group song because we are going to use this thing multiple times.

106
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,490
Press control to make them a group.

107
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,770
And this copy?

108
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,190
This stinks.

109
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:55,780
And I said just this ongoing episode like this, all of them, and it's legitimate upvotes like this,

110
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,060
and you can tune that time of it.

111
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,530
And also the name of their group as team.

112
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,030
This is like up to like seven point twenty one.

113
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:22,330
So let's copy this exactly the same thing on our personal section also.

114
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,030
All right.

115
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,090
You forgot to hold.

116
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:30,960
Like this?

117
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:38,980
OK, so first of all, listing the group name over here, let's say you have a list of all gamers.

118
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,160
And in the school group, nursing students.

119
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,640
So less added image on these two groups action subject to less image.

120
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,390
OK, so first one is the first images of our council, so I'm going to air this, imagine two cameras.

121
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,510
Second, when it's like students.

122
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:12,750
And let's say the imaginary students are programmers, so I'm glad were here.

123
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,670
So I think it does not make sense for this image, so I'm going to add over here.

124
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,130
So I think for Remercier to choose a different image.

125
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,420
Let's see our rumors out of the fan of Marvel saw him when I heard that Marvel image.

126
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:39,910
Let's say they are fired up like Loki, so soulless, add the look you make you look like this.

127
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:45,490
Let's say you edited the image, but the image is like not blessed very well, so you can double click

128
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:54,670
on it, go to film, select the image and you can choose a crop top and just that image.

129
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:00,250
Or you can like movies like this and cancel this one.

130
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:00,850
So.

131
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,270
The images placed now the message audio.

132
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,320
So I'm going to add some emojis.

133
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:14,410
I think in windows the shortcut is for images is Windows Plus or donkey?

134
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:26,520
So it will open the emoji panel audio so you can add emojis like this once again, as Anderson is saying.

135
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:28,860
I think this.

136
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:38,700
And over here, I'm going to parents and I'm like this.

137
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:46,070
So it totally depends on who you can like and do what you want.

138
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,200
So we are done with our group.

139
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,080
So let's say the name of this girl is the Rachel.

140
00:11:53,930 --> 00:12:01,640
Like, I'm a big fan of like friends, so that's why I did this animal is ritual, so you can earn whatever

141
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,320
you want, even already wear name or next name, it totally depends on you.

142
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,300
And the last one is going to be childbirth.

143
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:22,100
So take a look at some random text.

144
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:39,090
OK, so I did some random text over you, so like I have written the time, and so I think the message

145
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:43,740
from Rachel at eight 46.

146
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,200
So let's add image audio.

147
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,570
People have told this image.

148
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,770
OK, so images blessed now.

149
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:13,460
So in this section, we are going to be checked as well as copy this one.

150
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:19,500
Or out on the water section.

151
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,880
OK, so you can see the problem here.

152
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,670
So I copied this group, but the group is not visible, so I have to text again.

153
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,550
And the simple rectangle.

154
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:40,840
Over here.

155
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:46,640
I understand the color of beetroot like this, but one.

156
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:53,580
And the concern is going to be 20.

157
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,140
So let's make it a little bit bigger.

158
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,190
So let's add, Rachel, over here.

159
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:10,710
What if I like drag it over here, it is going to be add back, so we have to bring this at front or

160
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,900
click on it and choose bring to front.

161
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,640
And now let's split it over here.

162
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,180
OK.

163
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:24,380
So we have to make some changes or here like this at a stroke.

164
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,570
It's made of quite.

165
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,250
This change to the point.

166
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:47,680
Also in the corner of the text is going to be white and also increase the font size on a saying up to

167
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,380
24.

168
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,010
And currently she's online.

169
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,650
And we have got him on this one.

170
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,200
The system on this line.

171
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:13,840
Looking forward to do so, we have to some some consortium that is going to be out on the call and will

172
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:19,990
be able to flex and dragged it over here and the color of this background is white and also the color

173
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,400
of their tyquan is white.

174
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,790
So it is not visible.

175
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:30,520
So let's bring it into front to front, and let's check it out here.

176
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,880
OK?

177
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,510
Forty.

178
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:43,510
And this visit here, and I think I also tracked video one.

179
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,660
OK, so this year.

180
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:57,590
This is bringing bring to front, OK, this island is rich and poor and working.

181
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:05,850
So it is, Orlando, you might see in that three minutes or so in icon, we don't have that many, so

182
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:09,390
we have to create it manually by using three ellipses.

183
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,760
So let's clear that.

184
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,200
It's clear to them and it's like this.

185
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:25,650
I think we have to make it a bit smaller, so connected to $11, maybe like a billion or eight.

186
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:41,020
OK, so we didn't know when all this audio, so first, let's make it look like I'm 20, so it is going

187
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,570
to be easier to move from one place to another.

188
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,550
OK, so Saturday morning is thanks to air jets.

189
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,560
So let's copy this one.

190
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,730
Oh, that's great.

191
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,090
I think I have undeclared Bennett.

192
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,580
There is no color on the color palette.

193
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,350
OK, so this gray color.

194
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:09,560
Done.

195
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,300
Let's make it smaller.

196
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:16,910
So let's create.

197
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:18,930
Might.

198
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,980
OK.

199
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,610
Like this.

200
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,210
Less important.

201
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,340
Mike Burton over here.

202
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,170
And I think I so forward that people like them.

203
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,270
What clip?

204
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,750
And the camera.

205
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,920
OK, so let's end with them.

206
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,710
I mean, first of all, let's.

207
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:53,370
Make it bigger like a collect call and also change the color of it.

208
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,930
Let's turn, let's make it.

209
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,320
Like this current.

210
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,430
OK, now we're going to.

211
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,780
Listed on this chart.

212
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,640
S..

213
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:20,700
Well, this is going to be here, and I think the bill is white and it's all here.

214
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,720
So they sense it first.

215
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,010
OK.

216
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,990
OK, let's align these things.

217
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:38,030
OK, so these things are Leno and early next door here.

218
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,570
Let type your message.

219
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,190
It's making it a bit bigger.

220
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,200
I think Connecticut is 14.

221
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,460
I think it is going to be fine.

222
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:55,930
OK, thank you.

223
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,370
Yes.

224
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:05,520
OK, so things are demeaning that only the so I search on the go to guard in this section.

225
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,300
What?

226
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,170
I don't find anything, so I'm going to add some random charts for you.

227
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:14,190
Let's say I recommended a game to a region.

228
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:26,160
Let's give the corner to the supply of 20 straight Polygon.

229
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,360
OK.

230
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,900
And just queue on the corner to disappear like, all right.

231
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,500
I think I have to change the color of it so that the color of which.

232
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,180
Okay, so.

233
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,940
So we just kind of look like this, or let's make a group of them so we can use it multiple times.

234
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,430
Or to select and control cheap.

235
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,410
The over here is arid text.

236
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,530
So let's make it simple.

237
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:18,850
And for 20, the difference on how we can use your other favorite font.

238
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,690
The center.

239
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,830
I think that it's like this on this mechanism, we're despondent.

240
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,230
So it has decreased the following sites a little bit smaller.

241
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:43,690
OK.

242
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:47,330
Like this, and we have to earn time.

243
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:52,820
So I'm going to copy this one folder and drag it over here.

244
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:03,250
So let's create another that section, I can copy this one, but.

245
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:13,340
But I want to do this Polygon do like a left side, so I have to create the new one.

246
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,400
That's why that's why I have to create a new one.

247
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,860
It's most in the cultural picture.

248
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,240
You can be like a guy with different color or you can like a.

249
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,150
Used to say one, so I'm going to disagree.

250
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:28,910
One.

251
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,430
And so the polygon.

252
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,340
So this is where I finished my social media project.

253
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:59,460
So I know it, you might get a different way or you took inspiration from different applications like

254
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,690
Facebook or Instagram.

255
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,990
So it totally depends on, you know, what just might look different or better than me.

256
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:10,860
So this isn't a single page application, so we are not going to use the prototype.

257
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,740
So if we had multiple pages like music apps, so.

258
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,900
So in that app, we had multiple pages, like four pages.

259
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,430
So that's why we connected those projects.

260
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,680
So this is a single page.

261
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,690
So this is how my social media app looks like.

262
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:29,700
So that's important, too, and I will see you guys in the next project.
