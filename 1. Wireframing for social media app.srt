1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,810
Welcome back.

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:01,470
Welcome.

3
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:08,490
So, Raghu, tasked to create a social media app, so I know some might completed that task.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,850
So in this video, I'm going to create my vision for it.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,830
Let's create a new design while.

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,200
Okay, let's rename it.

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:27,540
So increasingly, I told you you can use like an iPhone frame or if you want to make a web application,

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,270
you can do that.

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,610
So for this project, I'm going to give it next door.

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,060
So let's first create a wire frame for it.

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:42,160
So in this section, we are going to have a groups like WhatsApp groups.

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:50,610
And in this situation, we are going to make personal messages.

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,050
And over here we are going to a chats.

14
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:18,470
So in this panel, we are going to have things like Home Chad setting the bell notification and the

15
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,150
power button.

16
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:28,880
Let's say the user is currently on the Charge six, and so the user will know from this bot, the user

17
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,440
will know he's in charge section.

18
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:36,620
OK, so this is going to be our group, so let's add some texture for you.

19
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,300
OK, so in this election, we are going to add a group, so let's take it over here.

20
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,400
And in this section, we are going to have a message from Postman's.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,990
And over here, we are going to have like a message from a group or message from personal.

22
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,530
Much like Rachel.

23
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:10,040
I had a call button over here, and, uh, it's also earned a video call button.

24
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:22,010
OK, I'm less clear that that works going, OK, listen, the color of the.

25
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,250
And over here, we are going to add.

26
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:33,150
I'm Michael, for local, and in this section, we are going to have some charts.

27
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,100
OK, so remaining things like iron of paperclip.

28
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,380
So in groups, we are going to hell like the small groups.

29
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,960
Groups from like your school or other individual groups for friends.

30
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:11,650
OK, and also in the person's personal, you can get messages from your friends or your teacher or your

31
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,360
colleagues like that.

32
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:18,100
So this is going to be our world frame for this project.

33
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,310
So this is how my vision is going to look like.

34
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,760
So I know you might be done in a different way.

35
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,020
So I took inspiration from like WhatsApp and Discord from to application.

36
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,730
So in the next word, I'm going to design a UI for our social media app.

37
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,530
So that's me signing off.

38
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,900
Thanks for watching, and I will see you guys in the next one.
